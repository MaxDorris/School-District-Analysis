## Deliverable 6: Summary

### Subject Grades: Charter vs. Public Schools
In this dataset, charter highschool scores were found to be higher for both reading and math than public highschools.

### Budget by School Type and Grade
Public high schools had higher budgets for each grade level (9th-12th) than charter high schools.

### Analysis
Despite having smaller budgets on average, charter highschool students outperformed public highschool students in subjects of reading and mathematics. An investigateion into class structure, educator hiring pools, and curriculum between school types would be necessary to better understand the root cause of this score gap.
